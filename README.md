Wildberries website parser in Python using bs4, Selenium, OpenPyXL libraries

The parser collects brands from the Icon market, searches for brands on wildberries 
and parses all product cards to search results by sorting duplicate ones. The results of the work are sorted out in excel tables, sorted by brands.

I do not debug the code in open access, such parsers are in demand, sorry)
